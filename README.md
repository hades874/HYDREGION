# HYDREGION (A Firefighter Robot)

An autonomous firefighting robot built with Arduino to detect and extinguish fires in hazardous environments. Designed to enhance human safety, reduce property damage, and support 24/7 fire response.

## 🌟 Features
- Flame detection using sensors
- Water pump for fire suppression
- BO motors with L293D for movement
- Buzzer alarm for alerts
- Arduino-controlled logic and wireless control support

## 🛠️ Key Technologies
- Arduino Uno R3 – Central microcontroller for logic and control
- Flame Sensors – Detect fire presence and guide the robot
- BO Motors + L293D Motor Driver – Enable movement and direction control
- Mini Water Pump – Dispenses water through nozzles to suppress fire
- Wireless Communication (Optional) – Bluetooth/Wi-Fi for remote operation
- Alarm System – Alerts nearby individuals during fire detection

## ⚙️ Working Principle
- Fire Detection: Flame sensors detect fire and send signals to the Arduino.
- Movement Control: Motors drive the robot towards the fire.
- Alarm Activation: Buzzer sounds to warn nearby people.
- Fire Extinguishing: Water is pumped and sprayed through nozzles.
- Autonomous Logic: Arduino processes data and makes movement/extinguishing decisions in real-time.
